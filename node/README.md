Features Descriptions:
User Accounts: User accounts form the foundational layer of our system, offering diverse functionalities. Account creation involves two crucial components: the selection of a unique username and a secure password. To ensure optimal security, passwords are stored securely within the system. Users have the liberty to personalize their profiles with unique avatars. The system provides streamlined processes for login and logout, along with the ability to edit and delete account information at will.

Articles: Our system boasts robust features for handling articles. Users can browse through a vast range of articles and sort them as desired. The system supports the addition, editing, and deletion of articles. Users can express their preference for articles by liking them. We have also developed an intuitive article editor, accompanied by the option to include images in articles for a richer experience.

Comments: The commenting system is designed to enhance user interaction. Users can post comments, view them in an organized manner, and delete their comments if necessary. The system offers functionalities to show or hide comments and supports nested comments for threading conversations.

Subscription and Social Network: The subscription feature allows users to follow their favourite content. Notifications ensure users stay up-to-date with new content and interactions. These notifications are displayed via an easily identifiable badge, with a comprehensive list of notification messages available for detailed viewing.

Analytics: The system is equipped with a comprehensive analytics tool. Users can view the most popular articles, determined by various metrics. Furthermore, a daily comment count chart provides insight into user engagement over time.

Usability and Interface Design: The blogging system is meticulously designed to offer an appealing look and feel while maintaining user-friendliness. The interface design is intuitive and engaging, ensuring users can navigate and utilize the system with ease.

API: The system's APIs support core functionalities such as login/logout, user retrieval, and user deletion, ensuring seamless integration and interaction with other services and systems.

Conclusion: In conclusion, this project presents a comprehensive blogging system, an epitome of robust functionalities, seamless user interactions, and streamlined processes.
